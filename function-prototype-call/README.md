## Description:

This code defines a custom implementation of the `call` method, named `myCall`, and attaches it to the `Function.prototype`. This means that all functions in JavaScript will inherit this `myCall` method. The purpose of `call` (and therefore `myCall`) is to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and a list of arguments.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1.  **`Function.prototype.myCall = function (thisArg, ...argArray) { ... }`**:

    * This defines the `myCall` function as a property of `Function.prototype`. The `this` keyword within this function will refer to the function that `myCall` is called upon.
    * `thisArg`: The value to be used as the `this` context when the function is invoked.
    * `...argArray`: A rest parameter that collects all the arguments passed to `myCall` after `thisArg` into an array. These are the arguments that will be passed to the function being called.

2.  **`const context = thisArg ?? globalThis;`**:

    * This line determines the context (`this` value) for the function call.
    * The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is used:
        * If `thisArg` is not `null` or `undefined`, `context` is set to `thisArg`.
        * If `thisArg` is `null` or `undefined`, `context` is set to `globalThis`. This is crucial because in non-strict mode, if `call` is given `null` or `undefined` as its first argument, the `this` value inside the function is the global object. `globalThis` is a standard way to access the global object in modern JavaScript (it works in browsers and Node.js).

3.  **`context.tempFn = this;`**:

    * This is the core of the implementation. It takes the function that `myCall` was called on (`this`) and assigns it as a property of the `context` object. The property is named `tempFn`. For example, if you call `myFunc.myCall(obj, 1, 2)`, then `myFunc` becomes a property of `obj`.

4.  **`const result = context.tempFn(...argArray);`**:

    * Now that the function is a method of the `context` object, it can be called using the standard dot notation (or bracket notation).
    * `context.tempFn()` invokes the function.
    * The spread syntax (`...argArray`) expands the arguments collected in `argArray` and passes them individually to the function.
    * The result of the function call is stored in the `result` variable.

5.  **`delete context.tempFn;`**:

    * This line cleans up the `context` object by deleting the temporary `tempFn` property. This is important to avoid polluting the object with extra properties, especially if the object passed as `thisArg` is an object that is used elsewhere in the code.

6.  **`return result;`**:

    * The function returns the value returned by the function that was called.
