# 🧬 Understanding Object Cloning in JavaScript

Cloning objects is a common task in JavaScript — especially when you want to copy objects without affecting the original.
 But not all clones are equal! This guide explains the difference between **shallow** and **deep** clones, why it matters, and how to implement deep clones safely.

## 🧪 Shallow Clone

A shallow clone copies **only the top-level** properties. Nested objects are still referenced.

```js
const original = { name: "John", address: { city: "Cairo" } };
const shallowCopy = { ...original };

shallowCopy.name = "Ali"; // OK
shallowCopy.address.city = "Alex"; // This also changes `original.address.city`

console.log(original.address.city); // "Alex" 😬


✅ Common methods for shallow clone:
Object.assign({}, obj)

{ ...obj } (spread operator)

🔁 Deep Clone
A deep clone recursively copies all nested objects, ensuring that changes in the cloned object don't affect the original.


const original = { name: "John", address: { city: "Cairo" } };
const deepCopy = deepClone(original);

deepCopy.address.city = "Alex";

console.log(original.address.city); // Still "Cairo" 🎉
🚨 Why Shallow Clone Can Fail
Shallow cloning is dangerous when:

Your object has nested objects or arrays.

You use the copy in ways that mutate nested data (e.g., updating a user.profile.avatar).

🔧 Ways to Deep Clone an Object
1. Using JSON
js
Copy
Edit
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
✅ Simple and fast
❌ Fails with:

Dates

Functions

undefined, Infinity, NaN

Circular references

2. Recursive Function
js
Copy
Edit
function deepClone(obj) {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== "object") return obj;

  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
    return obj.map(deepClone);
  }

  const cloned = {};
  for (let key in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      cloned[key] = deepClone(obj[key]);
    }
  }
  return cloned;
}
✅ Works for most standard objects
❌ Doesn’t handle special types like Date, Set, Map, etc.

3. Using Lodash
Lodash provides a powerful and battle-tested utility:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install lodash
js
Copy
Edit
import cloneDeep from "lodash/cloneDeep";

const deepCopy = cloneDeep(original);
✅ Handles edge cases
✅ Fast and reliable
❌ Adds a dependency (though it's a small one)

4. Using structuredClone (Modern Browsers / Node.js 17+)
js
Copy
Edit
const deepCopy = structuredClone(original);
✅ Native, fast, and safe
❌ Doesn't support functions or non-serializable values
❌ Not available in older browsers

✅ Conclusion
Use shallow clone when your object is flat.

Use deep clone when your object contains nested data or you want full isolation.

Prefer structuredClone or lodash/cloneDeep for safe deep cloning in production apps.

Avoid JSON.stringify unless you're sure the object is simple and doesn’t contain non-serializable data.

📁 Example Project

const user = {
  name: "Sarah",
  age: 25,
  address: { city: "Giza", zip: 12345 },
};

// Safe deep clone:
const copy = structuredClone(user); // or use cloneDeep(user)

// Mutate the copy:
copy.address.city = "Aswan";

// Verify isolation:
console.log(user.address.city); // Still "Giza"
